# MeDS_Server
Wifi subsystem for the MeDS senior design team (ECE 49022, Spring 2023) 

This repo is my (Mahesh Balachander) private repo for hosting all the code I've written relating to my subsystem and my software contribution to the project as a whole.
The primary thing to note would be the server file, which acts as a gateway for the mobile app and the microcontorller to talk to each other. 

Initially, the server will be deployed on the same network as the devices it facilitates communication between. 
Further down the line, the plan is to make it so the server can be accessed remotely (i.e across the internet) so fully enable remote communication.
